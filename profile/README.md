The Blue Sky Solar Racing Club (Blue Sky Club) based in the University of Toronto is an Engineering student club specializing in the design, construction, and racing of solar-powered vehicles. Since 1997, the Blue Sky Club has represented the University of Toronto in biennial solar racing events around the world. Bound by real-world constraints, the Blue Sky Club makes use of a multi-disciplinary design approach, the resources provided by the clubâ€™s supporters, and the passion of its members to develop and implement the best possible solutions to improve the racing performance of its vehicles.

We developed various open-source programs and libraries that can be used by others.
